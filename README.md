# Raid Editor

This https://github.com/simon-wh/PAYDAY-2-BeardLib-Editor for Raid WW2.
This is highly experimental so expect crashes, the part that was updated mostly for Raid was the environment editor.
I will update this as much, until I see actual mod support in Raid WW2, mostly I need the add files function for custom raids to be functional.
